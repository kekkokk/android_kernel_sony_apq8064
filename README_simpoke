[POWER]

The default power behavior of the stock lineage 15.1 kernel is simple:
Fast charge is enabled, only with few caveats:
- It ask the power management to give the max power (1500mA)
- The msm_otg disconnect watchdog listen for any "link" disconnection
- At every disconnection it decrease the current asked and starts a task to try to increase the power in an exponetial time manner

This way, your current may vary: for example, with a slim usb cable I could only get 1100mA or with an old charger only 900mA

With this tweak, from any Kernel manager os sysfs you can FORCE the fastcharge feature.
The default behavior is to force to 1500mA but you can also specify a specific value with the sysfs interface.

[BUILD OPTIMIZATION]

Thanks to the awesome miPa kernel, few flags are forwarded to the build toolchain to optimize this chip.

[BUILD TOOLS]

- Linaro GCC Toolchain v5 [https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/latest-5/arm-eabi/gcc-linaro-5.5.0-2017.10-x86_64_arm-eabi.tar.xz]
- unmkbootimg [https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/util-unmkbootimg.1877807/] to unpack stock initram and kernel from boot.img
- mkbootimg [https://github.com/osm0sis/mkbootimg/releases/tag/2020.05.18] to repack the bootimg following the unmkbootimg suggested steps
